#Connecting to OpenVPN

##Windows
Download the OpenVPN GUI, install it, and place the profile in the 'config' folder of your OpenVPN directory, i.e., in 'C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config'. After importing, connect to the VPN server on Windows by running the OpenVPN GUI with administrator permissions, right-clicking on the icon in the system tray, and clicking 'Connect'.


##Linux
Install OpenVPN using your package manager (APT in this example). Now, as root user, create the /etc/openvpn/client folder and prevent anyone but root to enter it (you only need to do this the first time):

'''
apt install openvpn
mkdir -p /etc/openvpn/client
chown root:root /etc/openvpn/client
chmod 700 /etc/openvpn/client
Move the config and connect (input the pass phrase if you set one):
'''

'''
mv whatever.ovpn /etc/openvpn/client/
openvpn /etc/openvpn/client/whatever.ovpn
'''

Press CTRL-C to disconnect.
